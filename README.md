# RNN-fly-courtship

feature selection: make a dummy female flies
    X dimension: 2 (female relative location) + 2 (female relative speed) + 2 (male absolute location)
    Y dimension: 2 (male absolute speed) + 2 (male wing angles)

batch data preparation: downsample the time sequence
1. check the length of the original sequences
2. decide the downsample rate
3. store the data
