Trying GLM on binary output, i.e. search or not, chase or not. 

About behavior bout, how to select them? First, look at the time length distribution of these two behaviors.

1. Behavior selection, do we need all the chase/search behavior?

2. Feature selection, primarily focus 'mfDist', add more features if necessary, for example if the 'mfDist' is noisy being an olfactory proxy, consider further description of female movement as the odor source 

3. GLM first, simple things first.

4. Use lab machine, not mine. Establish the remote access.
